The goal of my project is to introduce myself and create a portfolio for my art.

My website offers an About page that provides some insight into who I am as an artist. A full view of my art work can be seen on the Portfolio page.

Other pages, such as the Travel page, offers some more information on my interests, and the Contact page offers mock information to reach out to me.
