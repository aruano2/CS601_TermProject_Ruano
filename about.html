                <p>
                    Audrey is an aspiring artist with a strong interest in web development. She is hoping to work on
                    exciting web design projects with innovative and inclusive ogranizations in the future. User experience is
                    an important factor to Audrey as well and she aims to create more user-friendly and accessible sites.
                    With her background in design, she aims to apply aesthetic principals to all of her projects.

                    When she is not drawing or learning about web development, Audrey likes to invest in some of her other
                    passins. Other interests Audrey likes to explore are urban design and development, bike riding,
                    rollerblading, drawing, and reading about current events. A fun fact is that she has been trying
                    to memorize the name of every country in the world. With her aptitude towards creativity and inclusitivy,
                    as well as her curiousity for various subjects, she is hoping to inpsire more inlcusive and peaceful
                    attitudes through her work.
